Kenadian skin, [audio clip](https://youtu.be/4gCc--BGW30?t=115), etc copyright Kenadian.<br>
Code based on [https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/zombie-creeper](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/zombie-creeper) by piramiduss.<br>

### What does this resource pack do?
- All zombies use the Kenadian skin

Even since Mojang updated the baby zombie texture, baby zombies do not use the Ken skin.<br>
Other zombies (Husks, Drowned, etc) do not use the Ken skin.
- Dying zombies play the sound bite "I'm sorry Kenadian"

This is regardless of how the zombie dies.
- Dying zombies show the subtitle "Kenadian dies"

Don't think to hard about it.
